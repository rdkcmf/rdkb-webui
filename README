Overview
================

Web GUI code is developed with PHP. PHP extension is used for PHP code to access CCSP data models via CCSP Message Bus.

There are three portions:
1) CcspPhpExtension     -- CCSP PHP extension code
2) CcspPhpApi           -- CCSP PHP APIs, which in turn calls PHP extension
3) Styles               -- Web GUI code and configuration, including PHP files, theme related files, Java Scripts, etc...


PHP Extension and PHP APIs
==========================

See source/CcspPhpExtension/README for details


Styles - Web GUI code
==========================

Actual PHP code and other GUI files are located in "code" directory.

"config" directory contains the configuration file to run the lighttpd web server:

    .lighttpd.conf  -- configuration file for lighttpd
    .php.ini        -- configuration file for PHP. Included php.ini configures
                       the location of CcspPhpExtension "cosa.so" as follows:

                        extension_dir = "/fss/gw/usr/ccsp"
                        extension=cosa.so

                        The above settings needs to udpated should move the php extension to a different location.

    .webgui.sh      -- this script configures and starts lighttpd. This file should
                       be tailored to fit your needs.
